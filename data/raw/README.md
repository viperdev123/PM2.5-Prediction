Usage Recommendations:
Meteorological Analysis: Study trends in temperature, wind, and humidity across different regions.
Air Quality Monitoring: Evaluate air quality levels using pollutants and air quality indices.
Astronomical Events: Correlate moon phases and illumination with environmental conditions.
Environmental Research: Combine weather and air quality metrics for climate studies.
Data Limitations:
Temporal Granularity: Ensure updates are frequent enough for time-sensitive analysis.
Location Coverage: Verify that all required regions are represented adequately.
Accuracy: Dependent on the source and methodology of data collection.
